## RS-422 Fiber Optic Communication

Versitron's RS-422 fiber optic modems ensure robust data transmission in full-duplex mode, ideal for factory automation, broadcast, and energy monitoring systems. The RS-422 standard enables long-distance, point-to-point communication with excellent noise immunity when combined with the advantages of fiber optics.

These modems provide a reliable upgrade path from traditional copper-based serial links. By transmitting RS-422 signals over fiber, users benefit from increased security, longer transmission distances, and immunity to lightning and EMI—especially important in outdoor or industrial settings.
